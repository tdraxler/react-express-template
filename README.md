# React/Express Template
A simple Express server app that serves a simple React web app to the user

## How to Run This
Navigate to a directory with a terminal and clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/tdraxler/react-express-template.git
```

After that, run this sequence of commands to get everything set up:
```
cd react-express-template
npm install
npm run build
```

Finally, start the server with:

And navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the page.
At any time, you can terminate the server in the terminal with Ctrl+c
